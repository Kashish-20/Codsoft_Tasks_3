# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. By using historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, various machine learning algorithms are applied to predict churn.

Project Overview:

Data Loading: Import the dataset containing historical customer data with features such as usage behavior and demographics.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing any missing values and standardizing formats.

Data Cleaning: Further clean the dataset to remove noise and irrelevant information.

Feature Engineering: Use techniques like LabelEncoder and StandardScaler to transform and scale features for better model performance.

Model Building: Implement and train various models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Performance Comparison: Plot graphs to compare the performance of the different models.

Techniques and Tools:

Preprocessing: LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes

Evaluation: Performance comparison using visualizations
